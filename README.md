## CSS
For wide browser compatibility, the compiled CSS has been run through an online version of `autoprefixer` (https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and then minified (https://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/)

If you wish, CSS can be built by running
```
sass scss/style.scss build/css/style.css
```
from project root directory. However, doing so will replace the vendor prefixed and minified CSS file included in this repo.
